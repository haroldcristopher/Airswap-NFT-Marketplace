# Description

Your PR should at least have a ticket number linked to it.

Example:

`Fixes #101`

A short video or an image demonstrating the implementation is also helpful. Especially for designers checking your PR.

Create a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) if you're looking for feedback but not ready for a final review.

# Steps to test the change

Help the reviewer test what you implemented/changed. Include all the steps needed to perform the test.

Example:

1. Add environment variable `REACT_APP_VAR_X=value` in .env file
2. Run `yarn start`
3. Go to home page
4. Click on an NFT
5. Check component XYZ
